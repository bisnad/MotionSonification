# AI-Toolbox - Motion Sonification

The "Motion Sonification" category of the AI-Toolbox contains a collection digital musical instruments that can be controlled by performers to translate their movements into music. The instruments are implemented in the Supercollider programming environment and employ different sound synthesis and parameter mapping techniques.. 

The following tools are available:

- [SyntheticFlutes](SyntheticFlutes)

  A collection of waveguide sound synthesis models that can generate a wide sound palette that spans from wind instruments sounds like bass flutes, to more natural immersive sounds like the wind traveling through a glacier, or just simply breathing like sounds or air noise sounds.

- [SyntheticStrings](SyntheticStrings)

- [SyntheticVoices](SyntheticVoices)
